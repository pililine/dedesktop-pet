Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `niuniu`, state `running`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure magenta #FF00FF. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: the exact black-and-white cat in the reference: dominant black crown, narrow white forehead blaze, yellow-green eyes, pink nose, white chest and legs, black side patches, rounded compact body, subtle cyan pixel-edge accent. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: Preserve the exact semi-realistic pixel-art-adjacent sprite rendering, soft fur shading, proportions, markings, yellow-green eyes, pink nose, and subtle cyan edge accent from the reference..
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Working loop at a tiny open laptop: Niuniu actively types on the keyboard with alternating front paws, eyes focused on the screen, with a subtle determined head bob.

State requirements:
- Keep one consistent small open laptop and keyboard directly in front of Niuniu in all 6 frames.
- Animate an unmistakable continuous typing cycle: left paw presses, both paws center, right paw presses, brief focused pause, then repeat smoothly.
- Keep Niuniu seated and compact; the paws, eyes, ears, and head provide the motion.
- The laptop screen and keyboard must contain no text, code, logo, icon, or readable UI.
- Do not show literal foot-running, jogging, sprinting, treadmill motion, raised knees, long steps, pumping arms, directional travel, speed lines, dust clouds, floor shadows, motion trails, or detached motion effects.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.
